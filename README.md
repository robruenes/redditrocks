redditrocks only works if you have a Spotify Premium Subscription.

On top of this, you'll need:

* libspotify (https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/)
* pyspotify (https://github.com/mopidy/pyspotify)
* spotify_appkey.key in the same directory as redditrocks.

libspotify can be installed using Homebrew:

`brew install libspotify`

pyspotify can be installed using Pip:

`pip install --pre pyspotify`

A Spotify App Key can be downloaded by anyone with a Spotify Premium Subscription [here](https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/).
